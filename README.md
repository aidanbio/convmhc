<p>
The main web interface consists of the input form panel (left) and the result list panel (right).
Users can submit multiple peptide sequences and a HLA-I allele in the input form panel.
Once the prediction process is completed, the user can see the prediction results of the input peptides in the result list panel.
For each prediction result, the user can also identify the informative pixels captured by the DCNN on the transformed peptide binding image through a pop-up panel
